abstract = "<p>Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) are known for their stability, high pixel-to-pixel uniformity, and high-pixel operability, which are essential for large area imaging arrays. In this paper, we discuss the initial demonstration of QWIP devices, and the many years of progress that propelled this technology toward the demonstration of large format focal plane arrays. In addition, we present some potential applications of this technology in science and medicine.</p>",
