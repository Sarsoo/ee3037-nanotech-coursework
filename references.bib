abstract = "<p>Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) are known for their stability, high pixel-to-pixel uniformity, and high-pixel operability, which are essential for large area imaging arrays. In this paper, we discuss the initial demonstration of QWIP devices, and the many years of progress that propelled this technology toward the demonstration of large format focal plane arrays. In addition, we present some potential applications of this technology in science and medicine.</p>",

The mobility increases with decreasing temperature from 300 to 77 K in contrast to the results of In 1− x Ga x As grown directly on GaAs by vapor phase epitaxy.

abstract = "Protein misfolding and self-assembly of disease-related and disease-unrelated proteins and peptides into highly ordered β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils converts this self-assembly pathway in a ‘generic property’ of polypeptide chains. Hence, to gain a detailed knowledge about the underlying packing and fibrillation mechanisms of such a process the use of model proteins appears to be the key. Human serum albumin (HSA) appears to be an excellent candidate because it is highly abundant and plays fundamental biologic roles; it also displays a complex tertiary structure without any propensity to fibrillation in its native state. Thus, in this chapter, we first give a very brief summary of the main aspects of the origin of protein fibrillation. Subsequently, we describe how the various factor induce HSA fibrillation, and we also describe the possible aggregation pathways and the structure of the resulting fibrils."
