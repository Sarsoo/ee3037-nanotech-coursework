abstract = "<p>Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) are known for their stability, high pixel-to-pixel uniformity, and high-pixel operability, which are essential for large area imaging arrays. In this paper, we discuss the initial demonstration of QWIP devices, and the many years of progress that propelled this technology toward the demonstration of large format focal plane arrays. In addition, we present some potential applications of this technology in science and medicine.</p>",

abstract = "Very uniform In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As was grown on InP by liquid phase epitaxy. The electron mobility is 8450 cm 2 /V sec at 300 K and 27700 cm 2 /V sec at 77 K. The mobility increases with decreasing temperature from 300 to 77 K in contrast to the results of In 1− x Ga x As grown directly on GaAs by vapor phase epitaxy. The energy gap of this high‐mobility material is 0.750 eV at room temperature.",
